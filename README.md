This project was commissioned by a client on 2024-03-25. If you're interested in similar work, check out my freelance data analyst profile on [Fastwork](https://fastwork.id/user/darren7753).

## Objective
The aim of this project was to create an anomaly detection app capable of identifying irregularities in gas turbine data. By comparing user-provided data with a reference dataset prepared by the app, anomalies and deviations from expected patterns can be detected and flagged for further investigation.

## App Overview

The app provides several features for analyzing gas turbine data:
- **Data Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing gas turbine data.
- **Column Selection**: Users can select specific columns of interest for analysis.
- **Tolerance Setting**: Users can set a tolerance level to define acceptable deviations from expected values.
- **Metric Display**: The app displays metrics such as minimum, maximum, and average deviations for the selected columns.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations such as line charts are generated to illustrate trends and anomalies in the data.
- **Navigation**: Users can navigate through different metrics and columns for comprehensive analysis.
